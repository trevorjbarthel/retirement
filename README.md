# Military Transition & Retirement Calculator

A planning tool for U.S. service members leaving active duty: a transition
**timeline** (countdown, milestone grid, horizontal timeline, pre‑transition
breakdown, 6‑phase checklist) plus **pay/TSP/VA/state‑tax estimators**.

Originally a single static HTML file, it now runs on **Cloudflare Workers + D1**
with optional **email + password accounts** so a user's plan syncs across
devices. Guests still work fully offline (data stays in `localStorage`).

## Architecture

| Layer | What |
|------|------|
| Front‑end | `public/index.html` (vanilla JS, Tailwind/Lucide via CDN) + ES modules `public/js/{calc,store,auth-ui}.js` |
| Worker API | `src/` — [Hono](https://hono.dev) app: `/api/auth/*`, `/api/me`, `/api/plan`, `/api/account` |
| Auth | Self‑contained email+password. PBKDF2‑HMAC‑SHA‑256 (Web Crypto), HMAC‑signed `HttpOnly` session cookies, `token_version` revocation. No external services. |
| Data | D1 (`migrations/0001_init.sql`): `users` + one `plans` row per user (plan JSON incl. checklist) |
| Static serving | Workers Static Assets (`public/`), `run_worker_first: ["/api/*"]` |

- `public/js/calc.js` holds the **pure** data + calculation logic and is imported
  by both the browser and the test suite (one source of truth).
- `public/js/store.js` is the persistence seam: API when signed in, `localStorage`
  for guests; the page's `saveState`/`loadState` route through it.

## Prerequisites

- Node 22+ and npm (the pinned `wrangler` requires Node ≥ 22)
- A Cloudflare account + `npx wrangler login` (only for remote D1 / deploy)

## Setup

```bash
npm install

# Create the D1 database, then paste the printed database_id into wrangler.jsonc
npx wrangler d1 create mtc-db

# Apply the schema locally (and later remotely)
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply mtc-db --local

# Local secret for `wrangler dev` (already gitignored)
echo 'SESSION_SECRET=dev-only-change-me' > .dev.vars
```

## Develop

```bash
npm run dev        # wrangler dev — serves public/ + the API at http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

## Test

```bash
npm test           # vitest: pure-function tests (calc.js) + Worker/D1 integration (Miniflare)
npm run typecheck  # tsc on src/ + test/, then tsc -p tsconfig.calc.json on the shared calc.js
```

Tests use `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` against a local Miniflare D1 — no
Cloudflare account or network needed.

## Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply mtc-db --remote
npx wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET    # a long random value, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 48`
npx wrangler deploy
```

## API

| Method | Path | Auth | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | – | `{email,password}` | `201 {user}` + cookie |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | – | `{email,password}` | `200 {user}` + cookie |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | – | – | `204` |
| POST | `/api/auth/change-password` | ✓ | `{current,next}` | `204` |
| GET | `/api/me` | opt | – | `{user|null}` |
| GET | `/api/plan` | ✓ | – | `{plan, schema_version, updated_at}` |
| PUT | `/api/plan` | ✓ | `{plan, schema_version}` | `{updated_at}` |
| DELETE | `/api/account` | ✓ | – | `204` (cascades plan) |

State‑changing requests require an `X-Requested-With: fetch` header (the CSRF guard);
request bodies, when present, are parsed as JSON. (`Content-Type` itself is not
separately enforced — the custom header is what a cross‑site form cannot set.)

## Pay tables (auto‑refresh)

There is no official military‑pay API, so the basic‑pay table is **generated from
the official DFAS pages**. The committed data lives in `public/data/pay-tables.json`
(canonical) and `public/js/pay-tables.generated.js` (imported by `calc.js`).

- Regenerate locally: `npm run update-pay-tables -- --year 2026 --write`
  (parses DFAS, validates, rewrites both files). Use `--fixture` to run against
  the test fixtures (always a dry run).
- `.github/workflows/update-pay-tables.yml` runs the generator on demand
  (`workflow_dispatch`) and each January, then opens a **PR** with the new numbers
  for review — nothing auto‑deploys.
- The parser (`scripts/parse-pay-tables.mjs`) is pure and unit‑tested against
  `test/fixtures/dfas-*.html` via `npm run test:scripts`. Key convention:
  "2 or less" → key `2`, "Over N" → key `N+1`, flats collapsed.
- Generating from real DFAS fills the previously‑missing O‑8/O‑9/O‑10 rows. Until
  the first live run, those grades show a tailored manual‑entry prompt. The first
  live fetch must run where outbound internet is available (the Action runner).

## Notes & follow‑ups

- Tailwind/Lucide load from CDNs; for production consider self‑hosting/building
  CSS and adding security headers (CSP) — static assets are served edge‑direct,
  so header injection would need a Worker pass.
- **Auth rate limiting** is wired but inactive by default. `src/routes/auth.ts`
  calls an optional `AUTH_LIMITER` binding on `/login`, `/register`, and
  `/change-password`; when the binding is absent (local dev, tests, an
  un‑provisioned deploy) it's a no‑op. To activate, add a Cloudflare
  [Rate Limiting binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/rate-limit/)
  to `wrangler.jsonc`, e.g.:
  ```jsonc
  "unsafe": { "bindings": [
    { "name": "AUTH_LIMITER", "type": "ratelimit", "namespace_id": "1001",
      "simple": { "limit": 20, "period": 60 } }
  ] }
  ```
- **VA disability rates** in `calc.js` (`VA_RATES_2025`) are the veteran‑alone
  (no‑dependents) amounts on the Dec 1 2024 COLA vintage. Refresh them as a set
  (not per‑bracket) when a new COLA lands, and update `DATA_VINTAGE.vaRates` in
  the same change so the label and data never drift apart.
- **State tax** figures are damped‑effective‑rate *upper‑bound* estimates from a
  single top‑marginal rate per state, not bracket‑accurate; the UI labels them as
  approximate. For real accuracy, store a per‑state bracket schedule.
- **Multi‑tab / concurrent edits** use last‑write‑wins: two tabs of the same account
  autosave independently and the later PUT silently wins. A robust fix is optimistic
  concurrency on `plans.updated_at` (send the loaded `updated_at` as `base_updated_at`,
  return `409` on mismatch, and reconcile client‑side) — a deliberate follow‑up, not yet
  implemented.
